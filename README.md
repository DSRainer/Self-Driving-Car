# Self-Driving Car Simulation in JavaScript
This project is a self-driving car simulation implemented using vanilla JavaScript. The car utilizes virtual sensors to detect obstacles and avoid incoming traffic within a simulated environment.

Features
Car Driving Mechanics: Implements basic car movement and turning capabilities.
Road Definition: Defines the road layout and boundaries for the simulation.
Artificial Sensors: Equips the car with virtual sensors to detect obstacles and incoming traffic.
Collision Detection: This enables the car to identify and respond to potential collisions.
Traffic Simulation: Generates other vehicles to create a dynamic traffic environment.
Neural Network Integration: Incorporates a simple neural network to enhance decision-making processes.
Visualization Tools: Provides visual representations of sensor data and neural network operations.
Installation
To run the simulation locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/DSRainer/self-driving-car.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd self-driving-car
Open the index.html File:

You can open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to launch the simulation.

Usage
Start the Simulation: Upon opening the index.html file, the simulation will begin automatically.
Interact with the Simulation: Observe how the car navigates the road, detects obstacles, and avoids incoming traffic using its virtual sensors.
Project Structure
The project consists of several key files:

index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the simulation environment.
style.css: Contains the styling for the simulation interface.
main.js: Coordinates the overall functionality of the simulation.
car.js: Defines the car's properties and behaviors.
controls.js: Manages user inputs and car control mechanisms.
road.js: Sets up the road layout and boundaries.
sensor.js: Implements the car's virtual sensor system.
network.js: Contains the neural network logic for decision-making.
visualizer.js: Provides functions to visualize sensor data and neural network operations.
